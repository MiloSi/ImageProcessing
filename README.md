Project name : OpenCV_Study <br>
I learned opencv, and I wanted to upload what I learned.<br>
So I made some projects. One project had one repository.<br>
But I knew that I made too many repository. So I thought I should upload all opencv projects in one repository. <br>
Therefore I made Opencv_Study repository.  <br>
<br>
Of course, I can do a lot of things simply using opencv functions.  <br>
But, I thougth that using OpenCV functions without knowing the algorithm is not a good way to study and to get knowledge. <br>
<br>
So the purpose of this project is to train image processing technique.
